                <div class="card-content">
                    <h4>I. Introduction to Design Thinking</h4>
                    <p>Design Thinking is a human-centered, intentional process for creating new and relevant solutions that have a positive impact. It is a mindset that fosters creativity and innovation.</p>
                    <h4>Key Principles:</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Human-centric:</strong> Emphasizes empathy for users.</li>
                        <li><strong>Collaborative:</strong> Believes in the power of teamwork.</li>
                        <li><strong>Experimental:</strong> Encourages an iterative and hands-on approach.</li>
                        <li><strong>Optimistic:</strong> Assumes that a better solution is always possible.</li>
                        <li><strong>Divergent & Convergent Thinking:</strong> First, explore many possible solutions (diverge), then refine and select the most fitting one (converge).</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h4>The Design Thinking Process (Our Approach):</h4>
                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>Empathise:</strong> Understand the target users and the context of the problem.</li>
                        <li><strong>Define:</strong> Articulate the problem to be solved based on learnings from the empathize stage.</li>
                        <li><strong>Ideate:</strong> Brainstorm potential solutions.</li>
                        <li><strong>Prototype:</strong> Create tangible representations of ideas to test.</li>
                        <li><strong>Test:</strong> Engage in a continuous cycle of innovation to refine the design with users.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <h4>II. The Empathy Stage</h4>
                    <p>Empathy is the foundation of human-centered design. It involves understanding users’ needs, thoughts, feelings, and motivations.</p>
                    <h4>Methods for Building Empathy:</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Engage:</strong> Interact with and interview users.</li>
                        <li><strong>Observe:</strong> Watch users and their behavior in their natural context.</li>
                        <li><strong>Immerse:</strong> Experience what your users experience.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h4>Why Observation is Important:</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Interviewees might not know what they truly want or be able to articulate it.</li>
                        <li>It helps discover useful insights into how people use or misuse things in their natural environment.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h4>Users vs. Stakeholders:</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Users:</strong> Directly interact with a product to complete a task. Their focus is on usability, efficiency, and overall experience.</li>
                        <li><strong>Stakeholders:</strong> Have an interest in or are affected by the product, even if they don’t use it directly. They are concerned with broader objectives like business goals and ROI.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h4>Tools for Empathy:</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Stakeholder Mapping:</strong> A 2x2 grid to categorize stakeholders based on their influence and interest.</li>
                        <li><strong>User Persona Development:</strong> Creating detailed profiles of typical users.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h4>III. Empathy Map, Persona, and Customer Journey Map</h4>
                    <p>These tools help synthesize research findings from the empathy stage.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Empathy Map:</strong> A collaborative tool to gain a deeper understanding of users. It is divided into quadrants: Says, Thinks, Does, and Feels, with Pains and Gains also considered.</li>
                        <li><strong>Persona:</strong> A fictional character created to represent a target user group based on research. It includes details like name, age, goals, frustrations, and motivations.</li>
                        <li><strong>Customer Journey Map:</strong> A visual representation of a user’s experience with a product or service from start to finish. It maps out stages, actions, thoughts, emotions, and opportunities for improvement.</li>
                    </ul>

                <div class="card-content">
                    <h4>I. The Define Stage</h4>
                    <p>This stage involves synthesizing the findings from the empathy stage into an actionable problem statement, known as a Point of View (POV).</p>
                    <h4>Point of View (POV):</h4>
                    <p>A POV statement should:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Contain the user insight uncovered during the empathy stage.</li>
                        <li>Capture a unique design vision.</li>
                        <li>Inspire the design team.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h4>Structure of a POV:</h4>
                    <p>[USER]… needs… [NEED]… because… [SURPRISING INSIGHT].</p>
                    <h4>Problem Framing Techniques (Recap):</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>SWOT Analysis:</strong> Evaluates Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats to analyze problems and ideas.</li>
                        <li><strong>5 Whys:</strong> A technique to identify the root cause of a problem by repeatedly asking “why.”</li>
                        <li><strong>Gap Analysis:</strong> Compares the current state with the desired future state to identify gaps and create an action plan.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h4>II. The Ideate Stage</h4>
                    <p>This is the creative stage focused on generating a wide range of ideas and solutions.</p>
                    <h4>Why Ideation Matters:</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Moves beyond obvious solutions.</li>
                        <li>Encourages innovation and creativity.</li>
                        <li>Harnesses diverse perspectives.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h4>Ideation Techniques:</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Brainstorming:</strong> A group creativity technique to generate many ideas in a short period, emphasizing quantity over quality.</li>
                        <li><strong>SCAMPER:</strong> A structured method using prompts (Substitute, Combine, Adapt, Modify, Put to another use, Eliminate, Reverse) to enhance existing ideas.</li>
                        <li><strong>Journey Mapping:</strong> Visualizing the user’s experience to identify pain points and opportunities for improvement.</li>
                        <li><strong>Reverse Thinking:</strong> Flipping the problem to ask “How can we make it worse?” to uncover unconventional solutions.</li>
                        <li><strong>Six Thinking Hats:</strong> A method for looking at a problem from six distinct perspectives (Facts, Emotions, Cautions, Benefits, Creativity, Management) to ensure a balanced analysis.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h4>From POV to Ideation:</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>How Might We (HMW) Questions:</strong> Short questions that launch brainstorms. HMWs are derived from the POV statement to frame the ideation process. They should be broad enough for a wide range of solutions but narrow enough to provide helpful boundaries.</li>
                    </ul>

                <div class="card-content">
                    <h4>I. The Prototype Stage</h4>
                    <p>Prototyping involves creating simplified, tangible models of a solution to test ideas before full-scale development.</p>
                    <h4>Why Prototype?</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>To get ideas out of your head and into the physical world.</li>
                        <li>To learn and explore possibilities (“a prototype is worth a thousand pictures”).</li>
                        <li>To fail quickly and cheaply, allowing for rapid iteration.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h4>Types of Prototypes (Fidelity):</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Low-fidelity:</strong> Quick and simple models made from paper, pens, or through role-playing and storyboarding.</li>
                        <li><strong>Mid-fidelity:</strong> More detailed representations like wireframes and mock-ups.</li>
                        <li><strong>High-fidelity:</strong> Highly functional and interactive prototypes like pilots.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h4>Storyboarding:</h4>
                    <p>A graphic representation of a story or narrative, similar to a comic book, that pitches a solution by showing how a persona overcomes a problem using it.</p>
                    <h4>II. The Test Stage</h4>
                    <p>Testing involves observing real users as they interact with a prototype to gather feedback.</p>
                    <h4>Why Test?</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Early Validation:</strong> Catch design flaws and confusing features before development.</li>
                        <li><strong>User-Centered:</strong> Understand real users’ reactions, which may differ from assumptions.</li>
                        <li><strong>Save Resources:</strong> Paper tests are inexpensive yet can reveal major insights.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h4>The Testing Process:</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Introduce the Scenario:</strong> Explain the prototype and the user’s task.</li>
                        <li><strong>User Tries the Prototype:</strong> The user interacts with the prototype, often “thinking aloud.”</li>
                        <li><strong>Observe & Note:</strong> Watch for confusion, questions, and errors.</li>
                        <li><strong>Gather Quick Feedback:</strong> Ask what worked well and what was difficult.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h4>Roles in a Testing Session:</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>User (Tester):</strong> Acts as a first-time user trying to complete a task.</li>
                        <li><strong>Moderator:</strong> The prototype’s creator who guides the session and answers questions.</li>
                        <li><strong>Observer/Note-Taker:</strong> Watches the test and records feedback.</li>

                    <h4>I. Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)</h4>
                    <p>The SDLC is a systematic process for creating high-quality software that meets customer expectations within time and budget constraints. It is also known as the Software Development Process.</p>
                    <h4>Phases in a Typical SDLC:</h4>
                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>Planning:</strong> Identify the scope, feasibility, schedule, and budget.</li>
                        <li><strong>Analysis:</strong> Understand and document business needs and system requirements.</li>
                        <li><strong>Design:</strong> Create the system’s architecture based on the defined requirements.</li>
                        <li><strong>Implementation:</strong> Build the software solution.</li>
                        <li><strong>Testing:</strong> Verify that the system meets requirements and validate that it solves the problem.</li>
                        <li><strong>Deployment:</strong> Make the software available for use.</li>
                        <li><strong>Maintenance:</strong> Ensure the system continues to address the problem and handle its end-of-life.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <h4>II. Software Development Methodologies</h4>
                    <p>These are frameworks of specific deliverables and artifacts used by a project team.</p>
                    <h4>Waterfall Model:</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>A linear and sequential approach where each phase must be completed before the next begins.</li>
                        <li><strong>When to use:</strong> When requirements are clear and fixed, the technology is stable, and the project is short.</li>
                        <li><strong>Benefits:</strong> Simple, easy to manage, and well-documented.</li>
                        <li><strong>Drawbacks:</strong> Inflexible, no working software until late in the cycle, high risk, and difficult to accommodate changes.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h4>Agile Software Development:</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>A lightweight, iterative framework promoting close collaboration between the development team and business stakeholders. It is based on the values and principles of the Agile Manifesto.</li>
                        <li><strong>Agile Manifesto Values:</strong>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Individuals and interactions over processes and tools.</li>
                                <li>Working software over comprehensive documentation.</li>
                                <li>Customer collaboration over contract negotiation.</li>
                                <li>Responding to change over following a plan.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>When to use:</strong> Projects with frequently changing requirements.</li>
                        <li><strong>Benefits:</strong> Continuous customer feedback, responsive to change, and efficient design.</li>

                        <li><strong>Right Product:</strong> Ensures the software meets the actual needs of clients and end-users.</li>
                        <li><strong>Done Right & Manage Right:</strong> A quality set of requirements is crucial for successful planning, design, and implementation.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h4>Types of Requirements:</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Functional Requirements:</strong> Capabilities and features the system must have (e.g., an application must support placing orders).</li>
                        <li><strong>Non-functional Requirements:</strong> Constraints the system must meet (e.g., order saving must complete in less than 5 seconds). These often relate to performance, security, reliability, and usability.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h4>Techniques for Gathering Requirements:</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Interviews:</strong> Effective for in-depth understanding but can be time-consuming.</li>
                        <li><strong>Questionnaires:</strong> Economical for large, geographically dispersed groups but hard to construct well.</li>
                        <li><strong>Reviewing Documentation:</strong> Provides preliminary understanding but documents may be outdated.</li>
                        <li><strong>Observation:</strong> Offers first-hand experience but can be intrusive.</li>
                        <li><strong>Prototyping:</strong> Allows for early user feedback and can be cost-saving.</li>
                        <li><strong>Researching Vendor Solutions:</strong> Cheaper and less risky than building from scratch, but may not fully meet specific needs.</li>
                    </ul>
